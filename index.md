## About Me

I’m a senior at Lehigh University pursuing a bachelor’s degree in finance. My coursework covers corporate finance, financial modeling, accounting, portfolio management, and investment analysis. I have hands-on experience working with Excel, Python, Power BI, Access, Tableau, and R. I have completed two internships in fast-paced corporate finance environments, where I applied my skills to real-world financial challenges.


## Portfolio

_**[10-K Sentiment Analysis](/_layouts/report.md)**_

- Employed Python to scrape and parse SEC 10-K filings from all S&P 500 companies
- Applied sentiment analysis techniques to identify correlations between 10-K language tone and
subsequent stock return

---

_**[Regression Practice](/_layouts/regression.md)**_

- Applied statistical regression techniques to uncover correlations between various variables and home sale prices

---

_**[Replication of 'Lazy Prices'](https://donbowen.github.io/teamproject/)**_

- Cohen et al (2020) examined the language and construction of 10-K filings and showed that a portfolio that shorts “changers” and buys “nonchangers” earns up to 188 basis points per month in alpha
- We attempt to replicate their findings on data before the first draft of their paper was made public (2010) and extend the data to see if the results hold up after publication.
