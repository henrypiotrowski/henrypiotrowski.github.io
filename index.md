## About Me

I’m a senior at Lehigh University pursuing a bachelor’s degree in finance. My coursework covers corporate finance, financial modeling, accounting, portfolio management, and investment analysis. I have hands-on experience working with Excel, Python, Power BI, Access, Tableau, and R. I’m currently seeking full-time analyst roles in the financial services industry where I can apply my skills and continue to grow.
