## About Me

I’m a senior at Lehigh University pursuing a bachelor’s degree in finance. My coursework covers corporate finance, financial modeling, accounting, portfolio management, and investment analysis. I have hands-on experience working with Excel, Python, Power BI, Access, Tableau, and R. I have completed two internships in fast-paced corporate finance environments, where I applied my skills to real-world financial challenges.

  <strong><em>10-K Sentiment Analysis</em></strong>
</a>

- Employed Python to scrape and parse SEC 10-K filings from all S&P 500 companies
- Applied sentiment analysis techniques to identify correlations between 10-K language tone and
subsequent stock return

_**[Regression Practice](/portfolio/regression.md)**_

- Applied statistical regression techniques to uncover correlations between various variables and home sale prices

_**[Replication of 'Lazy Prices'](/portfolio/README-2.md)**_

- In their 2020 paper, Cohen, Malloy, and Nguyen analyzed the language and structure of 10-K filings and found that a portfolio strategy that shorts “changers” and buys  “nonchangers” can generate up to 188 basis points in alpha
- In this project, we replicate their findings using data prior to the paper’s initial public release (2010) and extend the analysis to subsequent years to assess whether the results persist post-publication
